<h1>The Story Behind Finish Him</h1>

<p>The swedish band Finish Him formed back in 1986 by Stefan
Elmgren and Stefan Soffiantini. They met because they hung around
in the same crowd based around a synthpopclub in central
Stockholm.<br>
Three days after the band formed they played their first gig as
support for two other bands, New Connection (with Soffiantini as
member) and Alderaan (with Elmgren).<br>
Since then they've been composing slowly but surely.<br>
For a time the band also contained singer Mikael Björndahl who
later became a Mormon never to be heard from again.<br>
At the moment Finish Him are more idle than ever,and no one knows
if or when they'll release another classic electronic hit.<br>
But who knows? if we get enough money from sponsorers
(nudge,nudge), something might surface.</p>
